# Tiny-Tracker
The application called TinyTracker is a real-time, Python-based application for tracking minute movements inside a captured footage. It captures video input from the user's camera for examining minute shifts instead of relying on a computer to analyze predefined streams of video.

# Key Features
Real-Time Detection: TinyTracker processes live video feeds from your camera, ensuring that any movement—no matter how small—is detected instantly. This feature is particularly useful for security, surveillance, and scientific research applications.

Versatile Input Options: In addition to live camera feeds, TinyTracker can analyze recorded video files, making it a flexible tool for various use cases. Users can upload videos for post-event analysis or monitor real-time scenarios.

Detailed Movement Analysis: TinyTracker not only detects movements but also provides detailed information about the nature and magnitude of the detected shifts. This data can be invaluable for studies, security assessments, or performance evaluations.

Using high-end features and real-time capabilities, TinyTracker is going to dominate the motion detection and analysis market. It is an excellent resource for personal, academic, as well as professional usage, allowing users to be more sensitive to the movement occurring around them by extracting insights that often turn into informed decisions based on actual data.
